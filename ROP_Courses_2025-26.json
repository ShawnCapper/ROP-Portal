    "Description": "In this project, students will work in a team to enter a global mineral exploration challenge (the Frank Arnott Challenge): https://www.pdac.ca/members/students/faa/about-the-award\n\nThe team will select an area and be given geologic, geophysical, and geochemical datasets that they will use to identify the most prospective subregion for mineral exploration. They will use these data to identify areas prospective for exploration for mineral deposits. They will then develop a presentation that will outline the area's they have selected and argue why these areas were chosen.",
    "AI_Description": "Students will work in teams to analyze geologic, geophysical, and geochemical data to identify prospective mineral exploration areas and present their findings in the Frank Arnott Challenge.",
    "Student Roles": "Students will fill roles depending on their academic background; for example, geology students will work with geophysics students to model the 3D geology of the area and its corresponding potential mineralization, while data science students will work with geoscience students to use supervised & unsupervised machine learning to identify mineralization. Business or mining engineering students could focus on determining the most economic subregions, by considering the balance between the value of specific minerals and the costs of developing a mine. Together, these students will work together to develop a robust exploration target. The team will meet with the supervising professors twice a week (typically in-person, but potentially over Zoom if other summer commitments arise).",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Students will take on roles based on their academic backgrounds, collaborating across geology, geophysics, data science, and business to model 3D geology, apply machine learning, and assess economic viability, with regular meetings with supervising professors.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "Students will obtain firsthand experience in target generation, a skill that is usually developed in professional settings when working in industry. Students will also get hands-on experience using Leapfrog and Geosoft, which are two commonly used software programs in the mineral exploration industry. Finally, students will get experience writing exploration proposals and giving presentations for investors, which is another important skill in real-world mineral exploration settings.",
    "AI_Academic Outcomes": "Students will gain hands-on experience in target generation, industry-standard software (Leapfrog and Geosoft), and developing exploration proposals and presentations for investors.",
    "Training & Mentorship": "During the course students will gain mentorship from both Swidinsky and Gregory but also graduate students who will be working on the same target generation project. This will provide multiple levels of mentorship and help students to broaden their network. Additionally, the contest has industry mentors who will be able to provide additional, practical mentorship. This will further aid students in extending their mentorship. Lastly, the end product will be assessed by a team of ~6 expert judges who will give a broad level of feedback for the students.",
    "AI_Training & Mentorship": "Students will receive mentorship from professors Swidinsky and Gregory, graduate students, and industry professionals, with additional feedback from expert judges.",
    "Selection Criteria": "Students will be selected based on a combination of GPA and how their unique expertise in geophysics, geology, geochemistry, machine learning, mining engineering or business (or any other relevant field) will be able aid in the team.",

    "Description": "Motis\nOur data have suggested that opiates work on a specific pathway out of the ventral midbrain to produce reward. However, when we tried to optogenetically stimulate this paper in a tonic matter, we observed aversions for the stimulation. We speculate and will test the idea that this pathway must be stimulated with the same pattern of stimulation that it shows after acute morphine injections that are rewarding.\n\nNeural SC\nThe primitive neural stem cell initiates the building of the brain and then gives rise to the definitive neural stem cells that does most of the work of building the brain. Both of these rare neural stem cells persist into the adult brain and we are studying how to activate these relatively quiescent adult neural stem cells brain to regenerate lost neural tissue.",
    "AI_Description": "Two projects: 1) Studying opiate reward pathways in the ventral midbrain 2) Studying primitive and definitive neural stem cells that persist into adult brain",
    "Student Roles": "ROP students can expect to learn such skills as sterile techniques, biosafety level 1, and how to collect and analyze data. In many cases, students will also learn academic collaboration protocols, including how to work with their peers and with other labs. ROP students will also be asked to present their data at our weekly chalk talks and biweekly journal club meetings.",
    "AI_Student Roles": "ROP students will learn sterile techniques, biosafety level 1, data collection and analysis. Students will present at weekly chalk talks and biweekly journal club meetings.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "Both projects: Technical skills will include: autoclaving, microscopy, screening, preparing solutions and running behavioural assays, pipetting, DNA analysis, mouse breeding, and how to critically analyze data. The application of these skills will be relevant in all laboratory settings and especially important to understanding how to analyze, interpret and present data. This work will involve single cell RNA sequencing of the purified neural stem cell types, as well as methods to activate the adult neural stem cells in vivo. In our characterization of primitive and definitive neural stem cells from mouse brains, we employ cell culture and histological techniques that the ROP students will learn.",
    "AI_Academic Outcomes": "Technical skills in autoclaving, microscopy, screening, behavioral assays, pipetting, DNA analysis, mouse breeding, and data analysis.",

    "Description": "The project for this course is the creation of an educational video game that teaches forensic science skills (collecting evidence, analysing the evidence in a lab, making statements about the analysis in court). This game is meant to be a virtual equivalent of a real-world assessment in forensic science courses, where students are presented with a scenario in a house that has been staged to resemble a crime scene. The game will model several of these crime scene scenarios, as well as the subsequent analysis and evidence presentation stages that follow.",
    "AI_Description": "Creating an educational video game teaching forensic science skills including evidence collection, lab analysis, and court presentation.",
    "Student Roles": "Students who take part in this project would be responsible for creating a single scenario in this virtual crime scene simulation. This would involve speaking with Forensic Science faculty and TAs to learn how the crime scene is staged, what actions the forensic students would perform and what assessment criteria are used in evaluating their performance. The student would use the ren'py framework to model the evidence collection, lab analysis and courtroom presentation for this scenario. This will require the students to storyboard the scene, create playable prototypes and incorporate feedback from faculty and players to arrive at a polished final product.",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Students will create scenarios in virtual crime scene simulation, working with Forensic Science faculty to model evidence collection, lab analysis, and courtroom presentation.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "Student enrolled in this course will get an introduction to basic game and user interface design.

The students will also have an opportunity to learn about forensic analysis and the key considerations when preparing assessments.",
    "AI_Academic Outcomes": "Introduction to game design, user interface design, client interactions, and understanding of forensic analysis and assessment preparation.",
    "Training & Mentorship": "Students in this ROP will be given weekly instruction on game design, user interfaces and user experience. They will learn about forensic analysis from the forensics faculty who are co-supervising the project. Students will need to have taken introductory programming courses before applying for this project, but our student mentors will provide guidance the ren'py framework (https://www.renpy.org/) and the creation of the game scenarios.",

This approach for fabricating systems is possible because of advances in the discovery and synthesis of a wide variety of nanostructures that can be used as building blocks. Also, there is a strong link between structure-behaviour at the nanoscale. Eg. \"quantum dots\" exhibit size-dependent optical and quantum effects; their discovery and development garnered a 2023 Nobel prize. We are particularly interested in \"engineering\" desired system behaviour from the bottom up. For example, this could enable us to shed light on previously observed but not well understood quantum phenomena even observe new phenomena. We also develop their potential device applications such as quantum electrochemistry, a field the Dhirani group is pioneering, and nanostructured direct solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion devices.",

    "Description": "We will build upon the research and model development completed by students between 2014 and 2024 in 3 areas. In the 1st area, we will explore the economic basis of social exclusion using insights from club theory and the Prisoners' Dilemma to test the emergence of scenarios, which produce a different outcome. The 2nd question looks at the long-term stability of urban form, a form that has been reproduces since humans started building settlements. We explore the resilience of this form by introducing errors into the simulation of its emergence. In the 3rd area, we will work use COBWEB to answer what-if questions about different designs for a vertical ecosystem. Using existing models means less time will be spent on model development and more time using the models to answer questions.",
    "AI_Description": "Research in economic basis of social exclusion, urban form stability, and vertical ecosystem design using COBWEB simulation.",
    "Student Roles": "As with previous ROPs, students will spend some time on identifying and reviewing the relevant literature in their area of research, writing an annotated bibliography and a literature review. Students will use systems diagrams and the literature review to refine their research question, existing gaps in the COBWEB model and modifications that are necessary to pursue our research question. Students are expected to work in a team to conduct this research, but some work will done individually. Students are expected to monitor communication from the Faculty Supervisor, respond to questions in a timely manner, attend the weekly lab meetings and contribute to the Lab environment through their professional and supportive interactions with regular attendees and visitors.",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Literature review, systems diagrams, model refinement, teamwork, and participation in weekly lab meetings.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "Students in this ROP will experience a research environment that will offer opportunities for growth through mentoring, teamwork and leadership. They will learn how to communicate their understanding of ideas, to develop critical thinking and connect ideas through writing a literature review, developing a systems diagram, and writing the final report. Visual communication and teamwork skills will be developed through working with others on a poster and a PowerPoint presentation. Students will learn the basics of experimental design and develop analytical thinking skills as they set up and draw conclusions from experiments. Students who would like to experience model development will be allowed to do so individually or through leading a team of high school students.",
    "AI_Academic Outcomes": "Research environment experience, mentoring, teamwork, leadership, critical thinking, communication skills, experimental design.",
    "Training & Mentorship": "Students will be provided training and supervision in all aspects of the research process from developing a question and reviewing the literature, to running experiments, data analysis, drawing conclusions and writing a final report. Since our primary tool is computer simulation, students will be trained in using simulation modelling in place of field work, the benefits of modelling and the limitations models in drawing conclusions about the real world. Because our primary tool, COBWEB, can simulate the outcomes of multiple populations, students will be trained on the basics of hypothesis testing using parametric and non-parametric statistics, and experimental design. Students will receive feedback on their writing can opt for training on model development, mentoring and leadership.",

    "Description": "Consider for a moment the range of images that one might categorize as a picture of a forest. These images may have a wide variety of characteristics, many of which could overlap with other categories of images (e.g. beaches or mountains). However, when we see a forest, we can immediately categorize it without the need to first recognize individual trees and then infer the forest. Humans are remarkably adept at this seemingly difficult perceptual categorization process, and for good reason --recognizing the essence of a scene (often called \"scene gist\"), provides important context for subsequent more detailed analysis of our visual environment. In our lab we are exploring the computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms of natural scene perception.",

    "Description": "Amnesia, meaning loss of memory, can be a devastating consequence of brain damage or disease. Although research has told us much about what areas in the brain are important for forming new memories, we still do not fully understand why people with amnesia forget new information so quickly. Recent exciting findings suggest that there may be a fundamental problem with the way amnesics perceive and attend to the world around them, which may partially underlie their deficit in memory. Students working on this project will investigate this possibility further, and in doing so, will provide new insights into how the brain supports memory. In addition, students may have the opportunity to contribute to experiments that are testing novel rehabilitative strategies to alleviate memory loss.",

How LDL exits the vascular lumen and crosses the endothelial monolayer is very poorly understood, in large part due to technical limitations in studying endothelial permeability. Our lab has devised novel assays to measure how LDL crosses the endothelium and is currently delineating the molecular mechanisms. Ultimately this work may lead to novel approaches to both the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. The methodology used includes high-resolution live cell imaging as well as traditional biochemical and molecular biology techniques.

    "Description": "At the StarLab for Mind and Development we investigate how children and adults reason about the social and moral world. The research topics we are interested in lie at the intersection of psychology and philosophy, including topics such as morality, fairness, ownership, conformity, and knowledge. Ongoing developmental studies include:\n* How do children and adults judge people who are struggling between acting morally and acting immorally?\n* How do children believe they will change over time? Adult show an \"end of history illusion\", believing they've changed a lot in the past, but won't change much in the future. Do even young children believe that they've stopped changing?\n* How do children and adults decide when someone's moral character has changed?",

    "Description": "A common challenge in laser physics is mode cleaning: increasing the coherence of a beam of light by suppressing or eliminating higher-order modes. An ideal mode filter would transmit 100% of the desired mode, and completely block all remaining modes. In the spatial domain, such an ideal filter exists: a single-mode fiber (SMF). When one cannot use an SMF for technical reasons (such as high laser power) or fundamental reasons (filtering higher-order spatial modes), an alternative approach for mode cleaning is to use a \"spatial filter\" consisting of a series of apertures interleaved with lenses and other optical elements. Here, we study to what extent one can achieve ideal filtering performance for an arbitrary spatial mode.",
    "AI_Description": "A common challenge in laser physics is mode cleaning: increasing the coherence of a beam of light by suppressing or eliminating higher-order modes.",
    "Student Roles": "In this project, the student will simulate a generalized version of the spatial filter, consisting of lenses (which act to guide and confine the light), and masks or apertures (used to block undesirable parts of the optical mode). The student will optimize the filter's performance by varying the positions and shapes of the constituent lenses and masks to maximize the transmission of the mode of interest while suppressing all others, aiming to approach the ideal performance of an SMF for arbitrary spatial modes. The student will verify the properties of the spatial filter they designed by validating its performance experimentally.",

    "Description": "Plants and fungi have evolved a chemical 'language of life' to coordinate their exchange of nutrients. The overarching goal of my research program is to translate the small molecule dialogue between plants and other organisms to improve plant, soil, and human health. However, we do not understand how plants and fungi respond to these signals in the soil. Mostly, this is because fungi and crops are genetically intractable. By turning to model systems like yeast and Arabidopsis, we have developed a pipeline to identify targets and processes of plant signals.",
    "AI_Description": "Plants and fungi have evolved a chemical 'language of life' to coordinate their exchange of nutrients.",
    "Student Roles": "Depending on our progress, the students could be involved in a variety of projects in the lab. In Project 1, the ROP students will isolate and characterize yeast mutants that have an altered response to plant signals using a set of reporters. They will perform genetic screens as well as growth and biochemical assays on either yeast or other fungi.\n\nIn Project 2, students will screen a mutagenized Arabidopsis population to isolate mutants defective in the synthesis of a novel secreted hormone. Students will propagate, harvest, and screen Arabidopsis populations for mutants. They will also identify candidate knockout lines that cannot make this hormone by extracting DNA, genotyping by PCR, and collecting plant exudates for biochemical analysis.",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Students will be involved in isolating and characterizing yeast mutants and screening mutagenized Arabidopsis populations.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "In both projects, students will learn principles of genetic analysis and the logic of signalling pathways. They will acquire molecular, cell biology, and biochemistry skills. In Project 1, students will learn sterile microbiological techniques and how to perform large-scale genetic screens and growth assays using a plate reader and automated equipment. Students will image cells on high-resolution microscopes to characterize fluorescent patterns and morphological phenotypes.\n\nIn Project 2, students will learn how to extract DNA from plants, genotype by PCR, and collect plant exudates for biochemical analysis. Students will image plant cells on high-resolution microscopes to characterize fluorescent patterns and morphological phenotypes. They will also gain bioinformatic skills to analyse sequences of candidate genes in the synthesis of the novel plant hormone and use the AI-based platform AlphaFold to predict structures and functions of these proteins.",

    "Training & Mentorship": "I will supervise, train, and mentor ROP students in collaboration with the postdocs and grad students in my lab. Depending on their project, students will work closely with a senior lab member to learn specific techniques. Our training method is to: (1) demonstrate the technique to the student, (2) supervise and provide feedback to the student by watching them perform the technique, (3) let the student perform the technique independently. I hold collaborative and constructive weekly lab meetings and small group meetings to keep track of student progress and assist with troubleshooting.\n\nStudents will communicate their research by giving short presentations to my group. They will also learn how to write a scientific report by conducting a literature survey and analysing their data.",

I then look at transcripts to ensure that students have taken and gained competence in appropriate subjects like genetics, molecular biology, and chemistry.

    "Description": "Critically ill patients often necessitate mechanical ventilation as a life-saving intervention, but mechanical ventilation itself can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). A significant challenge in current bedside practice is the uniform application of a one-size-fits-all ventilation strategy, which may prove inadequate for individual patients, contributing to injury. We have employed bioimaging techniques such as micro computed tomography (\u00c2\u00b5-CT) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to visualize mechanical ventilation effects in rabbits. These methods allow us to pinpoint areas of injury and measure lung strain, facilitating the identification of optimal ventilator strategies by customizing pressure and tidal volumes based on individual patient needs.",

Our objective is to single out specific sensor(s) that participate in obesity-associated diabetes and are activated by fat-derived products. NOD1 is a sensor candidate because it is located inside cells and induces low-grade inflammation. Our preliminary data using whole body NOD1 knockout mice show that fat impairs the response to insulin and the secretion to insulin via NOD1. We will now study mice that lack NOD1 in specific tissues that are responsible for the response to insulin and the production of insulin. Finally, we will explore the possibility of inhibiting NOD1 activation as a treatment of type 2 diabetes.",

    "Description": "Synaptic transmission is essential for neuronal communication in the brain. At synapses, electrical activity in the presynaptic neuron triggers rapid release of neurotransmitters in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The neuronal SNARE complex, consisting of syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin/VAMP-2, plays a central role in mediating neurotransmitter release through membrane fusion/exocytosis. This process is regulated by key proteins such as Munc18-1, Munc13, complexin, synaptotagmin and Tomosyn. Young children with mutations in genes that regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis can develop devastating phenotypes, which are presently without adequate therapies. For instance, mutations in syntaxin-1B, Munc18, Munc13 and Tomosyn underlie a wide spectrum of childhood epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of exocytosis remain largely unclear. Importantly, molecular mechanisms controlling synaptic transmitter exocytosis are highly conserved from C. elegans to humans. Using C. elegans as our model system, we will investigate the mechanisms of transmitter release.",

    "AI_Student Roles": "ROP students will be involved in genotyping, behavioral, pharmacological, and morphological assays.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "We aim to understand how SNARE proteins and the regulatory proteins interact with each other to achieve precise regulation of synaptic exocytosis. To address this question, it is important to examine their genetic interactions by generating double, triple and quadruple mutants.\n\nTo understand the interrelationship among the regulatory proteins, students will learn how to cross or mate the respective mutant strain to generate double and triple mutants. The students will then genotype the crossed animals using genotype PCR. The students will also learn how to analyze the phenotypes of the resulting mutants using behavioral and pharmacological assays. Behavioral assays are made by video recording of swimming worms and counting the number of thrashing behaviors. The pharmacological assays measure the sensitivity to aldicarb, an inhibitor of acetylcholine esterase. Since acetylcholine is the transmitter that is released from motor neurons to contract muscles, the sensitivity to aldicarb is proportional to the amount of released acetylcholine. In these processes, the students will learn the concept of genetic interactions among the regulatory proteins as well as behavioral and pharmacological assay techniques. The students will also learn how to modify the genome of C. elegans using CRISPR/Cas9 system and generate novel synaptic release mutants.",

    "Description": "Through analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from breast cancer patients we have identified a distinctive 'CTC-signature' or pattern of genetic changes that can be found at low levels in primary breast cancers but at higher levels in CTCs and breast cancer metastases. This progression is associated with changes in genomic heterogeneity or variability within the tumor (H score).\n\nWe believe that this 'CTC-signature' are genetic alterations that are critical for metastasis. Also, that the degree of its variation within the cells of a breast cancer is important. We think that further development of this `CTC signature' will lead to a useful predictor of metastasis and provide targetable alterations that can be used to block breast cancer metastasis and reduce deaths. It is important for us to validate the CTC signature in a larger number of patients than we originally studied.\n\nAs we expect our signature to have prognostic value, we will compare it to a widely used clinical tool (Oncotype Dx assay) and measure it in more breast cancer metastases.\n\nThese experiments will help us gain a better understanding of how breast cancer spreads beyond the breast. Most breast cancer deaths are a result of spread beyond the breast so it is vital that we learn more about this process. A better understanding will lead to strategies to block metastasis.",

    "Description": "Four students enrolled in this course will work with Prof. Li and the two postdoctoral fellows (Nathan Sandford and Gustavo Medina) in her group, along with other graduate students. The course will contain two sub-projects, with 2 students for each sub-project. The students will work together and collaborate as a team.\n\nProject 1: Searching for Stellar Streams with Large Scale Spectroscopic Survey Data\nOur galaxy, the Milky Way, is surrounded by numerous small galaxies and star clusters that can be influenced by its gravitational forces, leading to the formation of stellar streams-celestial \"rivers\" orbiting around our galaxy. These streams offer a unique opportunity for astronomers to delve into the mysteries of galaxy formation and the elusive nature of dark matter. Cutting-edge cosmic surveys provide access to comprehensive data on millions of stars in our universe, including their full 6D information (position and velocity). The ROP student will be at the forefront of developing a Bayesian framework to assess the membership probability of each star in potential streams and to characterize the properties of these stellar streams. This involves leveraging vast astronomical datasets, totaling several gigabytes of data, obtained from one of the largest spectroscopic surveys, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI, https://www.desi.lbl.gov/).\nIn this research project, the ROP student will explore the development and application of innovative statistical and computational techniques. These methodologies are crucial not only for unraveling the secrets hidden within stellar streams but also for paving the way for future astronomical surveys.\n\nProject 2: The Chemodynamical Evolution of the Smallest Galaxies\nThe chemical composition and kinematics of stars provide a unique tracer of a galaxy's evolution over cosmic time. Supernovae, stellar winds, and neutron star mergers each leave a unique signature in the abundance patterns of stars observed today through which a diverse range of astrophysical processes can be studied. The stellar chemistry of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way provides an especially powerful lens through which to study stellar and galactic physics, as their low-mass dark matter halos and ancient stellar populations make them sensitive to the physics of stellar feedback and star formation in the early Universe.\nIn this project, the ROP student will apply existing galactic chemical evolution and dynamical models to large stellar datasets of nearby dwarf galaxies collected by spectroscopic surveys. Depending on interest, the student can focus their investigation on the following topics: the Milky Way's accretion history of satellite galaxies, the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements, and the nature of star formation and stellar feedback.",
    "AI_Description": "Students will work on one of two sub-projects: 1) Searching for Stellar Streams with Large Scale Spectroscopic Survey Data or 2) The Chemodynamical Evolution of the Smallest Galaxies.",
    "Student Roles": "Students will engage in Python programming to analyze and visualize astronomical data, either by developing new code or modifying existing code. Specifically, the ROP student will focus on creating a Bayesian framework to evaluate star membership probabilities in stellar streams or dwarf galaxies, as well as characterizing stream and galaxy properties. They will regularly meet with supervisors for one-on-one sessions (at least weekly) to discuss project status, address challenges, and establish goals for subsequent meetings. Additionally, students will attend and present their project progress at weekly research group meetings, which include fellow undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in Prof. Li's research group.",

Additionally, weekly group meetings with Prof. Li's larger team will provide a broader research perspective, allowing students to learn from peers and present their work. Mentors will assist in providing and incorporating feedback into their research presentations.\n\nProjects will immerse students in interdisciplinary environments, and depending on the project, may offer participation in international networks and broader research collaborations.",

    "Description": "The main objective of this project is to examine how adult and child speakers of typologically different languages describe complex visual stimuli (events) across modalities (speech, gesture). We are interested in what event components tend to be encoded in speech and/or gesture and how these tendencies are affected by (a) the ways different languages express individual event components grammatically and (b) the knowledge state of a conversational partner. To achieve these objectives, we seek to create a video corpus of child and adult speakers of different languages describing the same battery of stimuli (i.e., videos depicting everyday actions; e.g., someone giving an object to someone else; someone performing an action using an instrument).",

    "Description": "My laboratory has focused on the study of the cell biology of specific neuropeptide-secreting neurons from the hypothalamus and has the expertise to perform detailed mechanistic analysis of cellular function. We have used the best available models of hypothalamic neurons, generated in my laboratory and used worldwide, to dissect and understand the molecular mechanisms utilized in the direct control of specific neuropeptides by peripheral signals, such as hormones, nutrients and neurotransmitters. We have previously found that exposure the saturated fatty acids causes neuroinflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress in hypothalamic neurons. Thus we aim to alleviate these detrimental effects with anti-inflammatories and other therapeutic compounds.\n\nWe will use our well-characterized clonal hypothalamic cell lines (Endocrinology 145:393-400, 2004; FASEB J 23:4256-65, 2010) to study exactly what neuropeptides may be sensitive to nutrient or industrial chemical-mediated regulation and whether specific signal transduction pathways and transcriptional mechanisms are directly involved in the regulation of specific neuropeptides linked to feeding. We intend to follow-up on these studies by blocking these pathways with pharmacological inhibitors.",

    "Description": "The urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon that emerges as vegetation is removed from urban areas, resulting in a warming effect that raises local temperatures by as much as 10 C. The UHI is of even more concern with the expected increase in extreme heatwaves, which are expected in a warmer climate. Warmer urban temperatures increase the energy demand for air conditioning, the frequency of severe pollution and heat-related health issues. Restoring vegetation or adding white surfaces to these areas are two strategies to reduce the urban heat island. We will build upon the research from the Urban Rewilding ROP that utilized the ENVIMet software to represent specific parts of a city, with and without vegetation/white walls at ground level, on the walls and on the roofs. We will be assessing how green roofs, walls and trees/shrubs affect the surface temperature on the building and on the temperature of the immediate area surrounding the building. Students will conduct research on a building surround by parking lot (i.e. a shopping mall), a building surround by a lawn (for example a school), bioswales/enhanced tree pits and other low-rise buildings. Preliminary work in the Urban Rewilding ROP has illustrated some interesting feedbacks when different surfaces are used in combination. These feedbacks will be explored further in this ROP. In particular, students will use ENVIMet to explore the feedback between white walls and temperatures in a parking lot. If sufficient information for any building is available, students will be able to use the results from ENVIMet in a building energy model.",

Importantly, antibodies have specificity for their corresponding antigens. This specificity makes them critical for targeting pathogens during the immune response, but it also makes them a useful tool for many molecular biology techniques.\n\nIn our group we use antibody-based techniques including western blotting, immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. We study a wide array of RNA processes, and for this we require antibodies for a variety of antigens. In this course, students will use molecular biology and biochemistry techniques to express and purify antibodies which can then be used for several collaborative projects. Plasmids will be constructed to encode antibodies, mammalian cells will be transfected with these plasmids to express antibodies, and antibodies will be purified and characterized.",

    "Description": "In most optical systems, light that is time-reversed by reversing its propagation direction and phase will exactly retrace its path. This property, known as reciprocity, is very general and has far-reaching consequences in optics (for example, this principle prevents the realization of true \"one-way mirrors\"). In the context of optical ring cavities (where light circulates either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction), reciprocity implies that the resonance frequency will generically be the same for light travelling in opposing directions.\n\nIn some applications, including laser cavities and gyroscopes, it would be desirable if these counter-propagating resonances had slightly different frequencies, which can only be achieved by adding a special \"non-reciprocal\" optical element into the cavity. The goal of this research project is to design these low-loss non-reciprocal optical elements, and test their performance in a laser power enhancement cavity.",

    "Description": "Fungi host diverse microbial communities, including bacteria that live as endosymbionts. These bacteria influence their host's metabolism, growth, and ecological interactions. However, many of these bacteria-fungi associations remain undiscovered, presenting an exciting opportunity to uncover novel biological relationships.\n\nIn the lab, we have observed bacteria that appear to reside in yeast. This project will employ advanced bioinformatics tools to identify bacterial communities within publicly available fungal genomic and metagenomic datasets. Students will develop computational pipelines to extract, classify, and analyze bacterial sequences, contributing to our understanding of microbial ecology and symbiosis.\n\nThe research questions are:\n1. Which bacterial species are commonly associated with fungi?\n2. How does bacterial diversity vary across fungal species or environments?\n3. What functional roles do bacterial genes play in fungi?\nTo identify and characterize bacterial communities associated with fungi, students will apply bioinformatics approaches on real-world genomic and metagenomic datasets from fungal species of interest. Examples include S. cerevisiae, Aspergillus, and Rhizopus. The student will use online tools and learn computational approaches to obtain and analyse large sequence data.\n\nThe methodology is as follows:\n1. Data Collection and Preparation\n* Retrieve fungal genome and metagenome of sequence read archive (SRA) datasets from repositories like NCBI, JGI, and EMBL-EBI.\n2. Bioinformatics Workflow\n* Classify bacterial sequences using taxonomic tools.\n* Assemble and bin genomes.\n* Validate bacterial sequences.\n3. Functional Annotation\n* Annotate bacterial genes.\n* Identify genes linked to nutrient exchange, secondary metabolite production, and symbiosis.\n4. Data Analysis and Visualization\n* Compare bacterial diversity across fungal species.\n* Visualize bacteria-fungi relationships.",

Furthermore, the student will construct phylogenetic trees to map bacterial diversity across the fungal kingdom. They will then generate evolutionary hypotheses about bacteria-fungi relationships.\nStudent responsibilities include:\n* Attending regular meetings with the research supervisor and team.\n* Completing assigned readings and training in bioinformatics tools.\n* Analyzing datasets and document findings systematically.\n* Preparing a final report and presentation summarizing the research outcomes.",

From previous work, we have identified a number of small molecules that we suspect are bioactivated by the nematode C. elegans into lethal products.

    "Student Roles": "The ROP student will use CRISPR-based technology to create a degron allele of the C. elegans cytochrome P450 POR (P450-oxido-reductase) co-factor EMB-8. Without EMB-8, C. elegans' P450s cannot function. Of note, a degron allele will be a fusion between the coding sequence of an auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag and the coding seqeunce of EMB-8. Upon exposure to the auxin small molecule, the EMB-8::AID fusion protein will become ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. With the C. elegans strain carrying the EMB-8 degron allele, the student will then test whether the suspected P450-bioactivated nematicides lose their lethality, which would support our hypothesis. The student will be responsible for using molecular biology to build the necessary DNA constructs, inject the nematodes with the constructs, create the required worm strain, and perform dose-response analyses to determine whether the candidate nematicides lose their lethality in worms with EMB-8 degraded.",

    "Description": "Student will have the opportunity to work across three related research areas in the laboratory:\n\nProject A Summary:\nFor refugee children, displacement and migration often correspond to a period of interrupted schooling and limited literacy instruction. As refugee children resettle in Canada, they resume learning to read at school. However, refugee children significantly lag behind their peers, both native English-speaking students as well as other newcomers to Canada and English language learners, in reading. While interrupted schooling clearly has a negative impact on literacy, little is known about the specific effects of interrupted schooling across the developmental trajectory for reading, and even less is known about the neurobiological mechanisms by which interrupted schooling impacts the neural systems that support reading. By leveraging the latest tools of educational neuroscience (functional neuroimaging tools, specifically functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy; fNIRS), this research examines the neural systems that support reading development for children who have experienced periods of interrupted schooling at different ages and who have resumed schooling, and learning to read, at an older age.\n\nProject B Summary:\nThis project directly addresses the two primary reasons for the learning crisis in C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire: poverty and child labor (which leads to low school enrollment and attendance), and poor teaching quality. To address child labor, this project tests the effects of the most extensively implemented and evidence-based approach-cash transfers (CTs)-which will offer families small amounts of money monthly to ease economic hardship and potentially permit the family to hire an adult farm labor support, in turn increasing the chance that their child will attend school, rather than working on a family plantation. To address educational quality, this project develops and tests the impacts of teacher training and electronic-coaching for teachers in rural communities and explore the utility of using adaptive information and communication technology (ICT)-based interactions for teacher professional development. Understanding if such a platform can affect behavior change and improve professional development will inform the use of similar programs across a range of settings and sectors beyond education. This project is an ongoing randomized control trial that evaluates the impact of poverty reduction (through cash transfers) and quality education on child labor and learning outcomes of children in rural C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Ivoire.\n\nProject C Summary:\nThere are over 1.1 million internally displaced children between the ages of 5-17 in Nigeria. This project evaluates the impact of a technology-enabled accelerated learning program to support out-of-school internally displaced and refugee children in IDP camps. The project examines the impacts of the accelerated learning program on learning outcomes (functional literacy and numeracy skills) as well as social-emotional skills, psychological well-being, educational aspirations, and later school enrollment and progression.",

    "Description": "The Heritage Language Variation and Change Project (HLVC, http://ngn.artsci.utoronto.ca/HLVC) documents and describes heritage languages spoken by immigrants and two generations of their descendants in Toronto. Our primary goal is to define the types of linguistic variation and change, working with conversational speech data from 10 languages. We seek curious students who are fluent in one of the languages in the project.\n\nGiven that over half of the world's population is multilingual, it's strange that in variationist sociolinguistics, the trend has been to examine one language at a time, essentially treating speakers as monolingual. The HLVC project documents and describes heritage languages spoken by immigrants and two generations of their descendants in the Greater Toronto Area, contrasting grammars at various degrees of contact to homeland varieties and to English spoken in those communities.\n  \nGoals include:\n* building a large corpus of Heritage Language data available to other researchers\n* using a standardized framework to examine variation in different languages and at different levels of grammar (e.g., pronunciation, morphology, sentence-structure).\n* defining the types of changes that do and do not occur in Heritage Languages more fully.\n\nA major contribution of this project is a standardized method for quantitative linguistic analysis of variation within multilingual communities, allowing the field to expand beyond its monolingual core and focus on English. We are moving beyond our field's bias toward examining larger, dominant languages. The languages we examine (Cantonese, Faetar, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Tagalog, Ukrainian) have been strategically selected for available resources, contrasting inherent traits, and degrees of divergence from English.\n\nWe analyse cross-generational change in the forms of the languages used. Building on existing methods of determining whether different varieties share the same grammar, we will determine how similar two grammars are, showing how much each generation's variety has shifted from the original (homeland) variety. From this, cross-linguistic comparisons will allow the development of a more generalized understanding of contact-induced language change in our multilingual metropolis. Prior to evaluation of the patterns of change over time, adequate description of selected aspects of each language, as currently used in Toronto, must be established. This approach requires ongoing collaboration between formal theory and variationist linguistics, so we seek students interested in both.",

    "Description": "For children in French Immersion, success in school is dependent on the ability to read for understanding in French and English. Over the middle to upper elementary years, reading comprehension is increasingly influenced by language skills (vocabulary, morphology, syntax, listening comprehension). Our research program has four specific objectives:\n1. to develop models formalizing the contribution of language skills to English and French reading comprehension in majority and minority language children between grades 3 and 6\n2. to investigate the direction and degree of English and French cross-language transfer over time\n3. to examine the effect of language status (children who speak English vs. a minority language as L1) on English and French language and literacy learning\n4. to explore other factors that may contribute to reading comprehension in English and French, such as executive functions (e.g., attention, memory, inhibition, etc.).",
    "AI_Description": "For children in French Immersion, success in school is dependent on the ability to read for understanding in French and English. Our research program examines language skills, cross-language transfer, and executive functions in reading comprehension.",
    "Student Roles": "The assistance of students will be required in all aspects of the research, including literacy review, research design, data collection, entry, management and analysis, and knowledge mobilization activities. ROP students will work very closely with me and my graduate students. Students who enrol in the 2025-2026 academic year will receive training for data collection and collect data in TDSB schools. Under our supervision, students will learn to enter, code, and analyze data with computer software such as Excel and SPSS. Students will also help with literature search and manuscript writing. They will have opportunities to present their work at lab meetings and professional conferences.",

    "Academic Outcomes": "Students will develop a good understanding of bilingual children's language and literacy development. They will acquire a variety of research skills, such as administering standardized and experimental measures to children, coding and entering data into a master database, and performing statistical analyses. They will gain academic skills by giving presentations at our lab meeting and the ROP research conference. Finally, they will develop communication and collaboration skills by working with other ROPs and research assistants in a team.",

    "Description": "Transitive inference enables us to predict a relationship between items that have never been presented together based on previous learning of a set of overlapping premises. Previous studies show that mice can correctly evaluate the unobserved relationship, as humans do. This opens up an opportunity to thoroughly investigate how this cognitive process is implemented in the brain by applying various biological research tools to mice. In this ROP project, we will monitor the expression of genes in brain cells in mice to identify which brain regions become activated during the transitive inference task.",

    "Description": "C. elegans offers an ideal platform for studying how a nervous system develops and operates to generate complex behaviors. While electron microscopy has enabled the reconstruction of the Caenorhabditis elegans connectome, determining synaptic connection strength based solely on structural information remains challenging. One of our approaches is to use calcium imaging of the C. elegans nervous system, monitoring the calcium concentration in neurons over time as they freely behave, to investigate how specific neurons contribute to specific behaviors. One challenge we face is implementing automated tracking, segmentation, and quantification of calcium signals as neurons move around in a 3D environment.",

The sodium leak channel NALCN is an essential channel conducting this current. Mutations of this channel caused severe intellectual disability, motor disability, developmental delay, cerebellar atrophy, and ataxia. While the crystalized structure and the basic biophysical properties have been identified, the role of this channel in circuit level and development is still largely unclear.

    "Description": "Past work has revealed developmental differences in creativity at both the neural and behavioural levels, but it is unclear how these differences relate to the development of processes like memory and learning. In this project, we are examining developmental change in the influence of episodic memory on different aspects of creativity, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to capture the neural correlates of creative cognition in adults and children (6-10 years old) and to understand how prefrontal brain regions support creativity. The objective of this study is to understand the developmental interplay between memory, learning, and creativity, aiming to elucidate how cognitive processes supporting creativity evolve. We will ask these questions using a variety of behavioural and brain imaging methodologies. The primary methodology of this ROP project involves fNIRS neuroimaging while participants complete computer-based tasks, in which we will measure participants' accuracy, verbal responses, and response times to assess their creative abilities. Students will be thoroughly trained on how to collect data with the fNIRS system and how to implement our tasks before independently collecting adult and child data. In addition to collecting fNIRS data from adults and children, students will learn the theoretical background of creativity, its development, and its neural basis, as well as the technical aspects of processing, analyzing, and visualizing fNIRS data.",
    "AI_Description": "This project examines developmental changes in creativity's relationship with memory and learning, using fNIRS to study neural correlates in adults and children.",
    "Student Roles": "Students will work closely with their research mentor and be involved in some of the following activities:\n1. Participating in lab meetings to discuss the student's research focus, other projects in the lab, and relevant empirical papers.\n2. Recruiting and scheduling child and adult participants in experiments and assisting with behavioral and/or fNIRS data collection.\n3. Contributing to experimental design, data analysis, and results interpretation.\n4. Developing computer programming skills (e.g., using R, jsPsych, or Python) by building experiments and/or analyzing data. Some students may gain exposure to fNIRS data analysis tools.\n5. Gaining scientific communication skills by writing research reports and giving oral presentations.",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Students will assist with participant recruitment, data collection, experimental design, data analysis, and results interpretation.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "During this ROP project, students will take on a developmental perspective and learn about how functional neuroimaging research is conducted in children and adults. By participating in this project, ROP students will be able to develop a deeper understanding of how creativity, memory and other cognitive processes change across development. Students will gain hands-on experience in:\n1. How research is conducted in a developmental cognitive neuroscience lab\n2. Reading, understanding, and analyzing scientific literature\n3. Participant recruitment and scheduling\n4. Data collection through computer-based tasks and our fNIRS system\n5. Analysis of fNIRS data\n6. Scientific communication and writing",
    "AI_Academic Outcomes": "Students will develop understanding of creativity development and gain experience in developmental cognitive neuroscience research methods.",
    "Training & Mentorship": "For this ROP project, students will be directly supervised by a graduate student or postdoc mentor. Students will regularly meet with their mentors to discuss project updates and training goals while receiving feedback on their performance in the lab. Students are expected to keep a written weekly log of hours and activities to be reviewed and graded to ensure that they are conducting research in an efficient, effective, and professional manner. In addition, students are expected to attend and contribute to weekly lab meetings and discussions about their own work, relevant empirical papers, and other projects in the lab. Students will write midterm and final reflections on their skills and experiences gained from the project and how they can be applied to their future career goals.",

    "Description": "The problem setting is structure elucidation: given an unknown chemical sample, what is its molecular structure? One approach is rotational spectroscopy, which measures the rotational constants of molecules in the gas-phase. These rotational constants are essentially 1/(moments of inertia), where the moments of inertia are a 3-number summary of the molecule's 3D mass distribution. We previously developed a generative model for predicting 3D molecular structure given molecular formula and moments of inertia. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12540) However, this work was only validated on synthetic datasets, with few computational resources. The goal of the present work is to apply this model to predict 3D structure in an actual experimental setting. The main challenge is to scale up prediction by using the model to generate many high-quality structure candidates, as well as rigorously verifying all candidates using quantum chemistry.",

    "Description": "Investigating the accuracy of computational chemistry methods in predicting reaction selectivity:\nThe selectivity of a chemical reaction shows the distribution of products generated by a reaction. Each mechanistic pathway that generates a product can be described by an overall energetic barrier, and the selectivity is determined by the relative ease of access between multiple mechanistic pathways. While these selectivities can be predicted using computational chemistry, due to the various approximations used by such methods to make them possible to calculate in a reasonable time, there are large deviations between predictions and experimental realities. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, one of the workhorse methods for computational organic chemistry, achieves good accuracies in the prediction of relative properties due to \"error cancellation\", where the systematic errors in these calculations cancel out. However, selectivities are the result of comparing two relative results. The common belief in the community is that error cancellation also carries over in such cases, but this is not well-established. The goal of this project is to determine if error cancellation occurs in the prediction of selectivities.\n\nThe impact of the boronic reagent on palladium-catalyzed protodeboronation:\nProtodeboronation is a significant side reaction that causes the decomposition of the key boronic reagent in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling, the second most used catalytic reaction in medicinal chemistry. Recent work has shown that bulky ligands, used to promote the cross-coupling reaction, can also cause significant protodeboronation. However, the structural and electronic natures of the boronic reagent also plays a key role in the degree of protodeboronation. While the base-catalysis of electron-deficient or sterically hindered boronic reagents have been investigated in detail, this is not well understood for palladium-catalyzed protodeboronation. This project aims to investigate in detail how the boronic reagent affects palladium-catalyzed protodeboronation.",

    "Description": "Abstracts:\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are flexible porous materials. Pore shapes of MOFs can be changed by pressure, temperature, and guest molecules. Contrary to rigid porous materials (e.g. zeolite), MOFs can undergo pore shape changes during gas adsorption isotherms. Such flexibility leads to decreased working capacity in MOFs' gas storage applications. The flexible properties of MOFs are affected by the components and structure of MOFs such as metal, linkers, and topologies. Thus, understanding the MOF structures and flexibility is highly important in designing high-performing MOFs. However, the relationship between the MOF structures and flexibility has not been clearly studied.\n\nIn this project, the students will learn and perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the reaction energy for breathing motion in MOFs, one of the most common motions during the gas storage process. Based on the reaction energy, we could predict the flexibility of MOFs. The students will use supercomputers (Compute Canada) or group clusters and learn how computational simulations are applied to real-world chemical research. Then, we build a database consisting of the reaction energies, features of MOFs (e.g. pore size, void volume), and components (e.g. metal and linkers used in the MOFs). By training machine learning models using the database, we could predict flexibility, systematically understand the relationship, and suggest how to design MOFs with minimized flexibility. Throughout this process, the students will acquire a comprehensive understanding of computer simulations and AI for chemistry workflow, including DFT calculations, supercomputing, chemical features, data collection, developing ML models, and other essential steps.\n\nObjectives:\n         * Understanding the relationship between the structure and flexibility of MOFs\nMethods:\n         * Software packages for DFT calculations: Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) for solid-state calculations and ORCA for calculating properties of organic linkers\n         * Collect structural features of MOFs: Zeo++\n         * Coding and machine learning: Python, RDkit, Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), and Pytorch\nThe students will do and learn:\n         * DFT calculations for molecules and solid materials\n         * Data collection for porous materials and molecules\n         * Machine learning for chemistry and materials design\n         * Mechanistic studies for chemical reactions",

    "Description": "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been widely used especially in display industries. From generation to generation, the color purity of light emission has been regarded as one of the key breakthrough points. Herein, organic semiconductor laser diodes (OSLDs) can be a game changer since they have ultra-high color purity while the history of OLEDs have never achieved. Recently, our group has reported an OSLD material screening platform using self-driving lab (SDL), accelerating the discovery of 288 new candidates. However, currently discovered molecules' lasing performance has obvious limitation - new family molecules that break the upper limit are needed. Fortunately, some literature reported another type of molecules that exhibit extraordinarily high-performance fluorescence. In this project, the students will join the discovery of the new-type organic laser molecules. At the beginning, the students will learn the principle of high-performance lasing and understand the structure of new-type organic laser molecules. Then, the students will build a database of commercial organic fragments that could be synthesized as proper target molecules. Once the database is established, we will purchase the fragments, and the student will synthesize the molecules. After the synthesis, the students will characterize the optical properties of the molecules to understand the expected lasing performance. Throughout this project, the students will obtain the comprehensive experience of novel molecule discovery suitable for high-throughput experiment.\n\nObjective:\nDefinition of new organic laser candidates\n\nMethod:\n         1.

    "Description": "Motivation: Molecular aggregates are formed through the assembly of individual molecules and exhibit distinct electronic and optical properties compared to their single-molecule counterparts. These properties arise from intermolecular interactions such as excitonic coupling, leading to J-aggregates (red-shifted absorption/emission) or H-aggregates (blue-shifted absorption/emission). Understanding and predicting these aggregate states is critical for advancing applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), light-harvesting for solar cells, photonics, and biosensing.\n\nPredicting the aggregate states and properties of organic molecules is a highly complex task due to the intricate interplay of molecular interactions, structural geometry, and environmental factors. Traditional computational methods, such as molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations, require significant computational resources to model the vast configurational space of possible aggregate structures, including different packing geometries and intermolecular forces. Moreover, the influence of external factors, such as solvent interactions, temperature, and substrate effects, adds another layer of complexity that hinders the rational design of molecular materials with tailored aggregate properties. On the other hand, experimental characterization of aggregates is resource-intensive and time-consuming as it often requires a combination of linear and non-linear spectroscopic techniques such as linear absorption, fluorescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, and transient absorption spectroscopies.\n\nMachine learning offers a powerful alternative by leveraging data-driven approaches to identify patterns and correlations that traditional methods fail to efficiently resolve, enabling rapid and accurate predictions of aggregation behavior and properties.\n\nObjectives: This project aims at predicting molecular aggregation and aggregate properties of organic molecules by:\n         * Creating a database linking single-molecule descriptors to aggregate states, including aggregate types (J- or H-aggregates), geometrical descriptors of aggregation, optical properties (absorption/emission frequencies, linewidths, and cross-section).\n         * Developing machine learning (ML) models to predict aggregate states directly from single-molecule descriptors, such as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System), representations embedded using graph neural networks (GNNs), Correlate aggregate descriptors with optical properties, enabling property-driven design of molecular aggregates, and validating the predictive models against experimental and computational datasets to ensure accuracy and generalizability.\nMethodology:\n         * Data Collection: a) Curate datasets of experimentally and computationally characterized aggregates. b) extract single-molecule descriptors (e.g., SMILES strings) and corresponding aggregate information (e.g., packing motifs, excitonic couplings and coherence lengths).\n         * Machine Learning Framework: a) Train supervised ML models, such as GNNs, to predict aggregate states (e.g., J- or H-aggregates) from single-molecule features. b) Train secondary models to correlate aggregate descriptors with optical properties.\n         * Validation and Benchmarking: a) Compare model predictions with known experimental data. b) Use molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical simulations to validate aggregate predictions for new molecules.",

    "Description": "Research Question: How can we use large language models (LLMs) to automate the creation of knowledge graphs and improve their accuracy with input from students?\n\nObjectives:\n* Develop a workflow that uses LLMs to create a knowledge graph for a robotic arm based on its action logs.\n* Test whether adding human knowledge as input improves the quality of the generated knowledge graph.\n\nMethodology: A knowledge graph is a way of organizing and representing information, showing concepts and their relationships in a clear and structured way. Typically, creating these graphs requires advanced technical tools and deep expertise, which can be time-consuming and challenging. LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are powerful tools that can generate text, write code, and handle large amounts of information. This project will use LLMs to analyse logs of a robotic arm's actions and automatically extract information to build a knowledge graph. Students will also explore how adding human input as prior knowledge affects the results, comparing graphs generated with and without this input.\n\nStudent Engagement: Students will actively participate in all stages of the project, including:\n            * Learning about knowledge graphs and how they can be used in technology.\n            * Experimenting with LLMs to extract information from robotic arm action logs.\n            * Testing and refining the workflow by adding their own insights to guide the LLMs.\n            * Comparing the results and documenting the effectiveness of the method.\n\nThis project is an excellent opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI tools and understand how knowledge representation can support real-world applications",

These two responses are strongly connected, as people make decisions about whether and where to move based on their beliefs about what different locations hold for them in the future. The work involved in this project is to approach this question scientifically. First, to gather and harmonize as much data as possible about disasters, migration, and beliefs. Then, to analyze this data to try to find suggestive patterns about responses. Then, to form hypotheses about what causal relationships are generating these patterns. Then, to formalize these hypotheses in the form of formal, testable models. Then, to estimate the parameters of those models using the data: \"bringing the model to the data.\" Finally, potentially after some rounds of model testing and reformulation, to use this model and its estimated parameters to make predictions about how people will respond to future disasters.",

    "Description": "Like other deontic-related terms, the concept of \"right\" is not at all univocal in Euro-American common parlance and not even in legal philosophy. Within this project, we will reconsider the concept of rights by comparing and contrasting it with cognate concepts within Sanskrit philosophy and legal thought, focusing especially on the term adhik?ra, variously translated as 'entitlement' or 'responsibility'. The main source will be the most relevant Sanskrit legal text, the M?navadharma??stra (also known as Manusm?ti or \"The Laws of Manu\"), together with its learned commentary by Medh?tithi (9th c. CE). We will analyse what adhik?ra entailed and how it interacted with other deontic terms, such as obligation, prohibition and permission.",

    "Description": "Digital technology is profoundly transforming the Humanities. This project introduces students to manual and AI-assisted paleography (the deciphering of old hand(writing)s), archival research, the process of digitizing an archive and the history of Early Modern colonization by the Society of Jesus, a christian order which is at the time the single most important source of information on Non-European cultures.\n\nThe documents to be transcribed are mostly Latin documents dating from the 16th-18th century from the archive of the Jesuit order in Rome, ARSI (Archivum Romanum Socieatis Iesu). One series of documents are letters linked to the missions in New France. To get permission to leave for foreign lands, Jesuit missionaries needed to petition their superior. These letters, so called \"letter\u00c3\u00a6 indipet\u00c3\u00a6\" (https://indipetae.bc.edu/) are the object of the first digital enterprise of ARSI in collaboration with a group of international researchers and the Toronto Jesuit History Research Group (TJHRG) runs this ROP project in collaboration with Boston College.\n\nAmong the clusters of documents there is also one related to the Jesuit missions in \"Huronia\", the region inhabited by the Huron- Wendat people North of the GTA. These documents offer a first hand testimony of the interaction between the indigenous people of Canada and \"Newcomers\", providing historical depth to current debates around Truth and Reconciliation.",
    "AI_Description": "This project explores how digital technology transforms the Humanities. Students gain hands-on experience with manual and AI-assisted paleography, archival research, digitization, OCR and translation software, and metadata analysis related to Jesuit missions.",
    "Student Roles": "Students learn about the organization of an archive, the process of digitization and the preparation of the documents for online use. They will learn about Finder Helpers, classification of documents, the production of digital images and their transcription using manual labor, AI, OCR and translation software. They will learn to research metadata which requires background research on the authors of the letters and the circumstances of their writing. They will go through all the different editorial stages of a document until its electronic publication. The goal is to build up an open access electronic database by providing transcribed documents with their metadata. Students will be given credit for their transcriptions by their names at the moment of publication in the online database.",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Students learn about archive organization, document transcription through manual and AI methods, metadata research, and the editorial process to build an open-access online database.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "Students will learn to handle digital material, to read \"olds hands\" (paleography) and develop computer skills (AI driven OCR-technology like Transkribus, chatgpt, DeepL, etc.). Students will participate in the various editorial stages and not only gain insights into historical and archival methods and the digital data management of the future, but also become part of the knowledge production process : they are credited for their work in the database.\nStudents will also learn about Western globalization, intercultural contact and knowledge production in the Jesuit missions to New France and Asia. Students can broaden their knowledge of foreign languages (Latin, French, Italian, etc.) and hone their interpersonal skills through team work in a scholarly community and an international network of scholars. It will also be an opportunity to reflect on the limits and opportunities of AI technologies in academic research and Digital humanities.",

    "Description": "The primary goal is to examine the impact of APLUS on support for incoming undergraduate U of T students' academic oral and written language development through self-guided and automated feedback support. The integration of APLUS into summer onboarding programs or through embedding APLUS into current curriculums will play a role in incoming students' transition into university studies by supporting student success and academic excellence, all the while facilitating a smoother transition to university life. The APLUS learning-oriented assessment platform was developed for instructors and students to assess and monitor students' academic communication skills using integrative tasks via the ISEF grant in 2020. As the automated machine scoring algorithms have become active after extensive validation based on human scores, the APLUS platform is ready to be widely adopted to significantly impact student support at the University of Toronto. We examine the relationship between oral and written communication ability and the role of self-concepts on students' communication skills. We further investigate valid ways to automate the data processing and scoring process for immediate feedback. We pay close attention to potential biases associated with students' accents and backgrounds in data scoring process using AI.\n\nPlease note: the deadline to apply for this ROP course has been extended to March 30, 11:59pm. An application to this course will not be counted towards the maximum of 5 ROP courses. If you've already submitted 5 applications, you can submit an additional application to this course.",

The main project, \"Mounds & Memory\", focuses on mounds and earthworks, monumental human-made landforms which have served for thousands of years as ceremonial gathering spaces, burial sites, astronomical landmarks, pilgrimage destinations, and centers of Indigenous politics, mobility, and commerce. Working in collaboration with Indigenous and settler public history organizations in the Great Lakes region, the Mounds and Memory project catalogues settler narratives of the mound builders and examines how they continue to have an effect on the mounds themselves. The project also documents and analyzes how Indigenous peoples have written and performed counter-narratives that center mounds as material witnesses of their ongoing relationship with the land, which they continue to visit and steward as places of ceremony. A second developing project focuses on helping to gather resources and transmit community histories related to Powwows in the area.\n\nPlease note: the deadline to apply for this ROP course is March 30, 11:59pm.

    "Description": "This course offers students the opportunity to actively participate in a meaningful research project that investigates how to improve the productivity and work experiences of disabled workers, specifically hearing-impaired food-delivery drivers on a major Chinese platform. The research addresses critical questions: How do disabled workers perform compared to non-disabled workers? What challenges do they face? How can new technologies or workplace policies help improve their performance and inclusion?\n\nThe project aims to fill a significant research gap by providing one of the first detailed analyses of productivity differences between disabled and non-disabled workers in the gig economy. The findings will offer valuable insights for platforms, policymakers, and researchers to develop strategies that promote workplace inclusion and productivity for disabled workers.\n\nThis ROP course has three key objectives:\n1. Understanding Productivity Patterns: Using a dataset covering over 60,000 workers, including 10,641 with disabilities, students will analyze weekly worker performance metrics, such as the number of completed orders, customer ratings, and delivery times. The analysis will also examine how disabled workers perform under different conditions, like extreme weather or peak hours.\n2. Identifying Challenges and Bottlenecks: Students will engage in ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with hearing-impaired workers to uncover the specific obstacles they face in their daily work. This qualitative approach complements the data analysis, providing deeper insights into the barriers to productivity.\n3. Evaluating Interventions: The study focuses on a real-time transcription tool introduced on the platform. This tool converts spoken language into text, enabling better communication between hearing-impaired workers, customers, and restaurants. Students will help assess its effectiveness using statistical techniques like difference-in-differences analysis.\n\nStudents enrolled in this course will gain hands-on experience in all stages of the research process:\n1. Data Analysis: Students will work with the rich administrative dataset, learning to clean and organize data, calculate productivity metrics, and perform advanced statistical analyses using software such as Stata, R, or Python.\n2. Fieldwork and Interviews: Students will assist in developing interview questions, conducting interviews with disabled workers, and transcribing the recordings. They will also have the opportunity to observe workers in the field, gaining firsthand insights into their experiences.\n3. Evaluating Results: Students will analyze the impact of the transcription tool and help identify mechanisms that improve productivity. They will also contribute to documenting findings for policy recommendations and academic presentations.\n4. Skill Development: Throughout the course, students will build valuable skills in quantitative data analysis, qualitative research, and academic writing. They will also gain experience in working within a diverse, inclusive research team, with training on equity, diversity, and inclusion principles.\n\nThis project's findings have the potential to influence workplace policies and technologies that support disabled workers. By participating, students will not only develop practical research skills but also contribute to addressing important societal issues, making this an impactful and enriching academic experience. Whether students are considering careers in economics, policy-making, or research, this course offers a unique opportunity to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges and make a difference.\n\nPlease note: the deadline to apply for this ROP course is March 30, 11:59pm. As this ROP course is posted on a later date (March 13), an application to this course will not be counted towards the maximum of 5 ROP courses.
