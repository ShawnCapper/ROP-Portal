    "Description": "In this project, students will work in a team to enter a global mineral exploration challenge (the Frank Arnott Challenge): https://www.pdac.ca/members/students/faa/about-the-award\n The team will select an area and be given geologic, geophysical, and geochemical datasets that they will use to identify the most prospective subregion for mineral exploration. They will use these data to identify areas prospective for exploration for mineral deposits. They will then develop a presentation that will outline the area's they have selected and argue why these areas were chosen.",
    "AI_Description": "Students will work in teams to analyze geologic, geophysical, and geochemical data to identify prospective mineral exploration areas and present their findings in the Frank Arnott Challenge.",
    "Student Roles": "Students will fill roles depending on their academic background; for example, geology students will work with geophysics students to model the 3D geology of the area and its corresponding potential mineralization, while data science students will work with geoscience students to use supervised & unsupervised machine learning to identify mineralization. Business or mining engineering students could focus on determining the most economic subregions, by considering the balance between the value of specific minerals and the costs of developing a mine. Together, these students will work together to develop a robust exploration target. The team will meet with the supervising professors twice a week (typically in-person, but potentially over Zoom if other summer commitments arise).",
    "AI_Student Roles": "Students will take on roles based on their academic backgrounds, collaborating across geology, geophysics, data science, and business to model 3D geology, apply machine learning, and assess economic viability, with regular meetings with supervising professors.",
    "Academic Outcomes": "Students will obtain firsthand experience in target generation, a skill that is usually developed in professional settings when working in industry. Students will also get hands-on experience using Leapfrog and Geosoft, which are two commonly used software programs in the mineral exploration industry. Finally, students will get experience writing exploration proposals and giving presentations for investors, which is another important skill in real-world mineral exploration settings.",
    "AI_Academic Outcomes": "Students will gain hands-on experience in target generation, industry-standard software (Leapfrog and Geosoft), and developing exploration proposals and presentations for investors.",
    "Training & Mentorship": "During the course students will gain mentorship from both Swidinsky and Gregory but also graduate students who will be working on the same target generation project. This will provide multiple levels of mentorship and help students to broaden their network. Additionally, the contest has industry mentors who will be able to provide additional, practical mentorship. This will further aid students in extending their mentorship. Lastly, the end product will be assessed by a team of ~6 expert judges who will give a broad level of feedback for the students.",
    "AI_Training & Mentorship": "Students will receive mentorship from professors Swidinsky and Gregory, graduate students, and industry professionals, with additional feedback from expert judges.",
    "Selection Criteria": "Students will be selected based on a combination of GPA and how their unique expertise in geophysics, geology, geochemistry, machine learning, mining engineering or business (or any other relevant field) will be able aid in the team.",
    "AI_Selection Criteria": "Students will be selected based on GPA and their expertise in geophysics, geology, geochemistry, machine learning, mining engineering, business, or other relevant fields to enhance the team.",
